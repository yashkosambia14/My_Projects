## Project 01   [ Basic User Interface to understand the python and its working ]

Goal of the Project

To manipulate user-inputted data that a user enters.
To print the user input data
To use string concatenation
To take entered data and arranges it to build a story template. 
Procedures on how to write this mini-project

Part 1: Ask the user to enter data. Save the user input data to variables. 

 

Ask the user to “Choose a noun: ”
Ask the user to “Choose a plural noun: ”
Ask the user to “Name a place: ”
Ask the user to “Choose an adjective (Describing word): ”
Ask the user to “Choose a noun: ”
 

Part 2: Display ALL the user input data using the print function and add some text using the concatenation. 
Given that noun and p-noun carry the first and second user input data from part1


## Project 02   [ Random number generator ]

Goal of the project

1. To manipulate user-inputted data that a user enters.
2. To print the user input data
3. To use string concatenation
4. To take entered data and arranges it to build a story template.


The program generates a random number from 1 to 10, or 1 to 100 any range that is specified by the user and the user must guess the number. Every time a user’s guess is wrong they are prompted with hints to make it easier for them to guess the number but at the cost of increasing the number of guess.


Challenges to do 

1. Use the random module from Python
2. Ask the user to enter what is the max possible random number 
3. Check if the user enter a number or a string and request the user to enter the number the next time 
4. Ask the user to guess the random number 
5. If the user enters the wrong guess, promote the user to enter below or above the wrong guess 
6. Inform the user with how many guess were done to guess the random number correctly 
7. Clear code and adding comments as appropriate 



## Project 03   [Machine Learning]

Goal of the Project

This python project is a good starter of machine learning using datasets. 

The dataset has 2 columns “YearsExperience” and “Salary” for 30 employees in a company. So in this project, we will train a Simple Linear Regression model to learn the correlation between the number of years of experience of each employee and their respective salary. 

The objectives of this project are: 
1. How to load the dataset into Python environment 
2. How to split the dataset into a training dataset and testing dataset in your model. 
3. How to apply linear regression model to the training dataset. 
4. Predict the test set. 
5. Visualizing the training and test set. 
6. How to make predictions for a value that does not exist in the dataset.
## Project 04   [Deep Learning]

Goal of the Project

This python project is a good start of deep learning using dataset.
In this project, we are going to build an AI neural network model to predict stock prices. Specifically, we
will work with the Tesla stock.
The objectives of this project are:
1. understand Neural networks.
2. understanding long short-term memory. 
3. working with some python Libraries.
4. How to build and train LSTM model using Keras from tensor flow.
5. How to load dataset into Python environment.
6. How to visualize your predicted data.
